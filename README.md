## Description

This repository contains an OpenFOAM-based CFD solver for simulating thermal phase change flows between liquid and vapor phases. The solver includes multiple phase change models, surface tension force models, and thermal transport modeling capabilities.

**Note:** The original version of this code was developed for OpenFOAM 2.4.0. This repository has been updated to be compatible with OpenFOAM.com OpenFOAM 2412.

## Building

Run the build script:

```bash
./Allwmake.sh
```
